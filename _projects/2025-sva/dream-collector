*Dream Collector* 
-
An web app and interactive installation  that uses AI to turn your scattered dream memories into vivid visuals.
– On the web app, you type in the fragments of a dream you recall, and an AI engine generates three images.
– In the TouchDesigner installation, the AI-generated images materialize in a darkened space. Using hand gestures, you peel back a virtual veil to reveal your own dreamscapes and then swipe through others’ past dreams in real time.
